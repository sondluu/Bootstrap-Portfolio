				<div id="article">
					<p>My name is Son. I have a background in supply chain management, specialized in oil and gas industry. Having been working in this industry for the past 7 years, I was excited about learning something new and challenging myself with potentially a new career option.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Why web development? Many people think of the field as one that offers plenty of career opportunities. Despite the fact that it is not a new discipline, there is still great demand and is expected to maintain that way for many more years. In addition, there may be many who know web development in and out, but how many, at the same time, can incorporate an esthetic sense into web development, a new skill in demand nowadays? In other words, there is still room for future developers with high potentials. Me personnaly, I am inspired by a career where you can do your job in complete distance, or be able to communicate with others at anytime, from anywhere. Living in a world that is more and more heavily driven by technology, especially the Internet, why not take advantage of the oportunity to live and connect with people and cultures from anywhere you are, at anytime you want! I am ready for this journey, and even though it won't be easy, I look forward to what it has to bring at the Finish line.</p>
